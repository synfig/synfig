# zlib not required because it is already part of OSX

# Travis-CI workaround
# When we install a package that is already installed inside the travis VM, and we have an outdated brew
# (for faster build), then we get an error and the build fails. Unfortunately brew doesn't have switch to skip
# already installed packages (https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/2491) and recommends to install using
# brew bundle. But! `brew bundle` can't be run without updating brew and fails with error "Your Homebrew is outdated".
# Yep, i know what and this is what i want. So here is workaround: first we check which package is not already installed,
# and if not then install it.
