/*	Explanation:

	A polynomial can be represented like so:
	Pn(x) = (x - x1)(x - x2)...(x - xn)	where xi = complex roots

	We can get the following:
	ln|Pn(x)| = ln|x - x1| + ln|x - x2| + ... + ln|x - xn|

	G := d ln|Pn(x)| / dx =
	+1/(x-x1) + 1/(x-x2) + ... + 1/(x-xn)

	and

	H := - d2 ln|Pn(x)| / d2x =
	+1/(x-x1)^2 + 1/(x-x2)^2 + ... + 1/(x-xn)^2

	which gives
	H = [Pn'/Pn]^2 - Pn''/Pn

	Laguerre's formula guesses that the root we are seeking x1 is located
	some distance a from our current guess x, and all the other roots are
	located at distance b.

	Using this:

	1/a + (n-1)/b = G

	and

	1/a^2 + (n-1)/b^2 = H

	which yields this solution for a:

	a = n / G +- sqrt( (n-1)(nH - G^2) )

	where +- is determined by which ever yields the largest magnitude for the denominator.
	a can easily be complex since the factor inside the square-root can be negative.

	This method iterates (x=x-a) until a is sufficiently small.

/* Given the degree m and the m+1 complex coefficients a[0..m] of the polynomial sum(i=0,m){a[i]x^i},
and given a complex value x, this routine improves x by laguerre's method until it converges,

is returned as `its'.
