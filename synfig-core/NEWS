  * Fix crash when inserting an item on a generic empty dynamic list.
  * Fix broken ffmpeg target that doesn't work for some non dot decimal points numeric locale settings.

 0.63.03 (git tag: "synfig-0.63.03") - December 05, 2011 - Features, bug fixes.

  * Support to create Advanced Outlines with the Draw Tool.
  * Fixed script to generate synfig API.
  * Added two new parameters to the WidthPoint class. Lower Boundary and Upper Boundary
    They define the lower and upper boundaries value of the widhtpoint position
    When placed at start and end of the BLine. By default lower = 0.0 and upper = 1.0
    Lower boundary must be always smaller than Upper boundary.
    As parameters they cannot be exported, converted or animated.
  * Render improvements for Advanced Outlines:
    With 'Fast' parameter disabled: 55% of reduction render time
    With 'Fast' parameter enabled: 10% of reduction render time
  * For Importer layer, even if file is physically impossible to open,
    set the parameter with the passed file name. This would allow to load and
    save Synfig's documents with paths for imported files badly adjusted but that user
    doesn't want to modify.
  * Fix for compatibility with libpng 1.5. Patch #3427945 by SpeckFleck.
