// class need to be grouped in joints and sequences before proceeding with
// conversion in quadratics - which works on single sequences.

// NOTE: Due to maxHeight, we have to assume that a single SkeletonGraph can
// hold
// more connected graphs at once.

// a) Isolate graph-like part of skeleton
// b) Retrieve remaining single sequences.
