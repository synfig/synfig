  * Fix bug #3111032: Load and save settings must be locale independent.
  * Added missing descriptions for several parameters.
  * Fix bug: Avoid negative precision to produce always good strings from angle.
  * Use º instead of DEG.
  * Added new descriptions for linkable value node parameters.
  * New advanced outline layer. Slidable variable width support and other features

 0.62.02 (git tag: "synfig-0.62.02") - November 13, 2010- Bug fixes, features

  * Fix load and save palette feature.
  * Code documentation. Not full yet.
  * Adapt api.sh script to run as a cron job at tuxfamily servers.
    Now API is updated at http://download.tuxfamily.org/synfig/api/index.html
  * Rename secondary layer's Z column to "Icon" and make it not reorderable.
    Make "Name" column resizable.
  * Britain English translation. Robert Readman.
  * Fix Bug #3029832 Time Offset parameter fails for multiple times imported files
  * Simplified Chinese translation. Yu Chen
  * New "By Layer Default" blend method.
    Now some layers define its own blend method instead of Composite or
    the selected by user. For example Shade->Behind
  * Fix bug #2958077. Incorrect fps in ListImporter
  * New Stroboscope Layer. Ray Fredesikson
  * Added "Static" option for individual parameters.
    If "Static" is on, then in animation mode it is no created any waypoint
    when modified. Only valid for layer parameters and constant value nodes.
  * Fix bug #3060560. Link two tangents and one is animated, the animated is not used.
  * Smart linking bline tangents implementation. Now all tangents are yellow ducks.
  * Move reverse manipulation code to Value Desc.
    This allows recursive reverse manipulation for valuenodes which has
    inverse manipulation implemented.
  * Assume frames when no unit is provided in a time field. Apply feature request #2879693
  * Spanish translation update.
  * New Simplified Chinese translation. Yu Chen

  * Improve SVG import support. Better support for gradients and some bug fixes.
  * Add code to make possible pass parameters to the renderers. Implementation for ffmpeg.
  * New Italian and German translations.
  * Automatic build script for linux system. Please report success of usage.
  * New parameters for Motion Blur layer. Now allows linear and constant interpolation too.
  * Updated Russian, French and Spanish translation
